 * Generate and store all language groups.
 * Random languages are generated all across the world, for use in people in local grids.
 * Some languages go extinct, while some grow into language groups, 
 * which can branch off with new related but distinct languages.
 * 
 * Just like in the real world, languages always evolve into new ones, in groups too.
 * For example, Latin, Old Germanic -> Early French, Early Spanish, Old English, ... 
 * (all past ones extinct or restricted) -> Middle English, ...
