/**
 * Provide utility methods for operating on society/household data,
 * which are used to provide decision data given to humans,
 * who can form new societies with other people.
 * 
 * People form societies with these common themes:
 * multiple families with similar ethos, race/family/marital connections, and proximity come together;
 * a family chooses to rule over others through might and strength;
 * a family uses its wealth to build a new society (relative). 
 * 
 * For technical reasons, the process of forming new societies, a group "free action"
 * (one that can be done at any time by consenting individuals),
 * is stored as a process (possibly at the society level?).
